#' Generate Participation Network
#'
#' Create a vessel-level fisheries participation network. Based on original 
#' function by Emma Fuller; edits specified in comments.
#'
#' @param tickets fish tickets data frame
#' @param edge_type type of edge weighting to use - the connectivity statistic ("connectivity"), or just number of vessels ("vessels")
#' @param pcid_choose specify an IOPAC port group
#' @param state_choose specify a US West Coast State
#' @param year_choose Specify a crab year
#' @param filter use the `min_vessels` and `min_contribution` objects to filter the data
#' @param filter_subgraph a filtering option from the original function that was turned off for Fisher et al.
#' @param min_vessels the minimum number of vessels participating in a fishery for that fishery to be retained in the network
#' @param min_contribution the minimum contribution (as a proportion) to total exvessel revenue across all vessels for a fishery to be retained in the network
#' @param min_rev the minimum revenue (in dollars) generated from all fisheries for a given vessel in a given year
#' @param min_rev_indiv the minimum revenue (in dollars) generated from any one fishery for a given vessel in a given year
#' @param write_out specify whether to write out the adjacency matrix A that is used to build the graph. not yet coded in below, will make it easier if you want to manually adjust the igraph vertex / edge attributes later. 
#' @return non-confidential fisheries partition network as an igraph object
