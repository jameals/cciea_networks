# Description

This document generates fisheries participation networks for the US West Coast using a variety of approaches. 

It makes network graphs and calculates network statistics.

A related file "plot_annual_networks_4ways.Rmd" visually summarizes a subset of these networks for presentation to the SSC-ES in September 2021.

# Setup

<br>
```{r "setup", include=FALSE}
if(!require("here")) {install.packages("here")}
library(here)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here::here())

## start time for full script
script_start_time <- Sys.time()
```
<br>

This script requires the following packages. 
```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if(!require("tidyverse")) {install.packages("tidyverse")}
if(!require("lubridate")) {install.packages("lubridate")}
if(!require("ggplot2")) {install.packages("ggplot2")}
if(!require("igraph")) {install.packages("igraph")}
```
<br>

And calls the following functions:
```{r}
source("R/generate_participation_network.R") # this function is for vessel-level networks, summarized at the port or state scale
source("R/generate_participation_network_bulk.R") # this function is for aggregate networks, summarized at the port or state scale
source("R/color_network_nodes.R")
source("R/network_stats_functions.R")
source("R/calc_network_stats.R")
```
<br>

# User Inputs 

Select your directories. These should be relative paths, since the here() function will start from within the github repository. 
```{r}
## location of fish ticket with metiers assigned, metier key for each port group
indir = '../cciea_networks-CONFIDENTIAL/data/input'

## output directory for igraph objects
outdir_ports = 'data/networks/participation_vessel_ports'
outdir_states = 'data/networks/participation_vessel_states'
outdir_ports_agg = 'data/networks/participation_agg_ports'
outdir_states_agg = 'data/networks/participation_agg_states'

## output directory for network viz
pngdir_ports = 'data/networks/participation_vessel_ports/plots'
pngdir_states = 'data/networks/participation_vessel_states/plots'
pngdir_ports_agg = 'data/networks/participation_agg_ports/plots'
pngdir_states_agg = 'data/networks/participation_agg_ports/plots'

## output file (including directory) for stat summaries
statdir = 'results/statistics'

## directory for species group key. not confidential
processdir <- "data/input"
```
<br>

Specify file name of the species groupings lookup key that contains labels for the network graphs.
```{r get_filenames}

myfile5 <- "spgrpn2_iea_key.csv"

```
<br>


Identify the crab years, port groups, and states that you would like to produce networks for. The port groups vector should include only those port groups which are present in the single data file produced with script 00. The states vector should include only those states which are present in the agid column of the fishtix data produced with script 00. 
```{r}
## (crab) years
years <- seq(2004,2019)

## IOPAC port groups
myports <- c("Puget Sound","North WA Coast","WA Coast","Other Coastal Washington","Astoria","Tillamook","Columbia River","Newport","Coos Bay","Brookings","Crescent City","Eureka","Morro Bay","Fort Bragg","Bodega Bay","San Francisco","San Diego","Monterey","Santa Barbara","Los Angeles","Unknown Ports" )

# wa_ports <- myports[1:4]
# or_ports <- myports[5:10]
# ca_ports <- myports[11:20]

## west coast states
mystates <- c("C", "O","W")

```
<br>

Some Dungeness crab landings may be recorded prior to the official opening date of the season as a part of domoic acid testing. We remove these landings because we are interested in flows of fishers between fisheries as a result of within-season activity.
```{r}
rm_crab = TRUE
```
<br>

For confidentiality, three or more vessels must be participating in a given fishery for that fishery to be included in the networks. To avoid inclusion of rare or minimal fishing activity, a given fishery must contribute to at least 10% of a vessel's seasonal revenue to be included in the network data. 

The cutoff values can be increased if more stringent fishery inclusion criteria are preferred, and the contribution cutoff may be decreased (i.e. for summaries over shorter temporal / smaller spatial scales).
```{r}

vessel_cutoff <- 3
contr_cutoff <- 0.10

```
<br>


Set these objects according to your user inputs from Scripts 1 and 3
```{r}
## the value of `k` for the k-nearest neighbor function
k <- 1

## the reference years first run through infomap
## for the cciea network analysis this does not matter because we use a prior sp groupings
ref_years <- c(2004,2005)
```
<br>


# Generate all networks

Develop networks 4 ways (also see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aIT1-5g2DL1G_ru0lsewWjwo7lzi6KTjz4Gq_gT_yyI/edit#heading=h.ivbgl81113fr for definitions): 

1) vessel-level summarized by port group (n=21)
2) vessel-level summarized by state (n=3)
3) aggregate summarized by port group (n=21)
4) aggregate summarized by state (n=3).

We will make these network graphs for 2004-2020, with all of the various permutations of our assumptions. These assumptions include:
A) For vessel-level networks, a minimum annual individual fisheries revenue cutoff for each vessel of `$1`, with a minimum annual total fisheries revenue cutoff for each vessel of (i) `$1` vs (ii) `$5,000`.
B) For vessel-level networks, a minimum annual total fisheries revenue cutoff for each vessel of `$5,000`, with a minimum annual individual fisheries revenue cutoff for each vessel of (i) `$1` vs (ii) `$500`.
C) For both vessel-level and aggregate networks, edges defined based on (i) connectivity vs (ii) number of vessels. For vessel-level networks, we will use a minimum annual total fisheries revenue cutoff for each vessel of `$5,000` and a minimum annual individual fisheries revenue cutoff for each vessel of `$500`.

So that is 4 versions of each of the vessel-level networks and 2 versions of the aggregate networks, for each of the 16 years, which will lead to 2,304 network graphs. 

## Read in data

Read in the landings data, from the file containing all fish tickets across port groups, within a single crab year.

NOTE: this step takes a while.

NOTES FOR JAMEAL: 
1) read in fish ticket files with this naming convention: fish_tickets_crab2004_processed_for_networks.csv
2) if species groupings column is named something other than metier.name, you'll have to go through the generate_participation_network.R function to replace it (done, JS note 010521)
```{r}
for(y in years){
  if(y %in% ref_years){
    tmptix <- read.csv(here::here(indir, paste0("/fish_tickets_crab", y, "_processed_for_networks.csv")), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
    filter(IOPAC %in% myports)
  } else{
    tmptix <- read.csv(here::here(indir, paste0("/fish_tickets_crab", y, "_processed_for_networks.csv")), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
    filter(IOPAC %in% myports)
  }
  if(exists('fishtix')){
    fishtix <- rbind(fishtix, tmptix)
  } else{ fishtix <- tmptix }
}
rm(tmptix)

# some checks on species groups
unique(fishtix$SPGRPN2)
length(which(is.na(fishtix$SPGRPN2)))
unique(fishtix[which(is.na(fishtix$SPGRPN2)),]$spid)
unique(fishtix[which(is.na(fishtix$SPGRPN2)),]$year)
unique(fishtix[which(is.na(fishtix$SPGRPN2)),]$agid)
unique(fishtix[which(is.na(fishtix$SPGRPN2)),]$pcid)

```
<br>

Make sure that all dates are `Posixt` objects and species group labels are characters.
```{r}
#dates_df$odate <- mdy(dates_df$odate)
fishtix$tdate <- date(parse_date_time(fishtix$tdate, orders=c("ymd", "mdy")))
fishtix$SPGRPN2 = as.character(fishtix$SPGRPN2)
```
<br>

Node names
```{r}

#### Read in species group labels key ####
node_names <- read_csv(here::here(processdir,myfile5),
                       col_types = list(col_character(), col_character(), col_character()))

```
<br>

## Make Participation Networks

For each crab year and port group, this code will:
1. Create a `graph` object for each fisheries participation network, and then save the object as an R data file

2. Plot the network graphs

3. Calculate network-level statistics, and save to an output data frame.

### 1) Vessel-level networks summarized by port group

#### A)(i) A minimum annual total and individual fisheries revenue cutoff for each vessel of $1

We only include vessels that generate >=`$1` in total fisheries revenue each year and >=`$1` in revenue from individual fisheries.

```{r}

total_rev_cutoff <- 1
indiv_rev_cutoff <- 1
edgetype <- "connectivity"
