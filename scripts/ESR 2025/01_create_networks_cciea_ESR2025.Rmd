# Description

This document generates fisheries participation networks for US West Coast port groups using the following approach:

- networks are based on fisheries participation and revenues at the vessel level, rather than aggregated across vessels for individual ports or states;
- edges in the networks are based on a connectivity definition (the amount and evenness of revenue across pairs of nodes);
- nodes (fisheries) that do not contribute to at least a median of 10% of the annual revenue of associated vessels are excluded;
- nodes (fisheries) are included in each network with a minimum total fisheries revenue cutoff for vessels of `$5,000` and a minimum revenue cutoff for individual fisheries of `$500`

The code makes network graphs and calculates network statistics.

A related file "plot_annual_networks_cciea.Rmd" visually summarizes a subset of these networks for presentation to the SSC-ES in September 2021.

# Setup

<br>
```{r "setup", include=FALSE}
if(!require("here")) {install.packages("here")}
library(here)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here::here())

## start time for full script
script_start_time <- Sys.time()
```
<br>

This script requires the following packages. 
```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if(!require("tidyverse")) {install.packages("tidyverse")}
if(!require("lubridate")) {install.packages("lubridate")}
if(!require("ggplot2")) {install.packages("ggplot2")}
if(!require("igraph")) {install.packages("igraph")}
```
<br>

And calls the following functions:
```{r}
source("R/generate_participation_network.R") # this function is for vessel-level networks, summarized at the port or state scale
source("R/color_network_nodes.R")
source("R/network_stats_functions.R")
source("R/calc_network_stats.R")
```
<br>

# User Inputs 

Select your directories.
```{r}
## location of fish ticket with metiers assigned, metier key for each port group
indir = '/Users/jameal.samhouri/Documents/CCIEA Networks/processed'

## output directory for igraph objects
outdir_ports = 'data/networks/participation_vessel_ports'
# outdir_states = 'data/networks/participation_vessel_states'

## output directory for network viz
pngdir_ports = 'data/networks/participation_vessel_ports/plots'
# pngdir_states = 'data/networks/participation_vessel_states/plots'

## output file (including directory) for stat summaries
statdir = 'results/statistics'

## directory for species group key. not confidential
processdir <- "data/input"
```
<br>

Specify file name of the species groupings lookup key that contains labels for the network graphs.
```{r get_filenames}

myfile5 <- "spgrpn2_iea_key.csv"

```
<br>


Identify the crab years, port groups, and states that you would like to produce networks for. The port groups vector should include only those port groups which are present in the single data file produced with script 00. The states vector should include only those states which are present in the agid column of the fishtix data produced with script 00. 
```{r}
## (crab) years
years <- seq(2004,2023)

## IOPAC port groups
myports <- c("Puget Sound","North WA Coast","WA Coast","Other Coastal Washington","Astoria","Tillamook","Columbia River","Newport","Coos Bay","Brookings","Crescent City","Eureka","Morro Bay","Fort Bragg","Bodega Bay","San Francisco","San Diego","Monterey","Santa Barbara","Los Angeles","Unknown Ports" )

# wa_ports <- myports[1:4]
# or_ports <- myports[5:10]
# ca_ports <- myports[11:20]

## west coast states
mystates <- c("C", "O","W")

```
<br>

Some Dungeness crab landings may be recorded prior to the official opening date of the season as a part of domoic acid testing. We remove these landings because we are interested in flows of fishers between fisheries as a result of within-season activity.
```{r}
rm_crab = TRUE
```
<br>

For confidentiality, three or more vessels must be participating in a given fishery for that fishery to be included in the networks. To avoid inclusion of rare or minimal fishing activity, a given fishery must contribute to at least 10% of a vessel's seasonal revenue to be included in the network data. 

The cutoff values can be increased if more stringent fishery inclusion criteria are preferred, and the contribution cutoff may be decreased (i.e. for summaries over shorter temporal / smaller spatial scales).
```{r}

vessel_cutoff <- 3
contr_cutoff <- 0.10

```
<br>


Set these objects according to your user inputs from Scripts 1 and 3
```{r}
## the value of `k` for the k-nearest neighbor function
k <- 1

## the reference years first run through infomap
## for the cciea network analysis this does not matter because we use a prior sp groupings
ref_years <- c(2004,2005)
```
<br>


# Generate all networks

Develop vessel-level networks summarized by port group (n=21).

We will make these network graphs for 2004-2024. 


## Read in data

Read in the landings data, from the file containing all fish tickets across port groups, within a single crab year.

NOTE: this step takes a while.

NOTES FOR JAMEAL: 
1) read in fish ticket files with this naming convention: fish_tickets_crab2004_processed_for_networks_2024-12-31.csv
2) if species groupings column is named something other than metier.name, you'll have to go through the generate_participation_network.R function to replace it (done, JS note 010521)
```{r}
for(y in years){
  if(y %in% ref_years){
    tmptix <- read.csv(paste0(indir,"/fish_tickets_crab", y, "_processed_for_networks_2024-12-31.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
    filter(IOPAC %in% myports)
  } else{
    tmptix <- read.csv(paste0(indir,"/fish_tickets_crab", y, "_processed_for_networks_2024-12-31.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
    filter(IOPAC %in% myports)
  }
  if(exists('fishtix')){
    fishtix <- rbind(fishtix, tmptix)
  } else{ fishtix <- tmptix }
}
rm(tmptix)

# some checks on species groups
unique(fishtix$SPGRPN2)
length(which(is.na(fishtix$SPGRPN2)))
unique(fishtix[which(is.na(fishtix$SPGRPN2)),]$spid)
unique(fishtix[which(is.na(fishtix$SPGRPN2)),]$year)
unique(fishtix[which(is.na(fishtix$SPGRPN2)),]$agid)
unique(fishtix[which(is.na(fishtix$SPGRPN2)),]$pcid)

```
<br>

Make sure that all dates are `Posixt` objects and species group labels are characters.
```{r}
#dates_df$odate <- mdy(dates_df$odate)
fishtix$tdate <- date(parse_date_time(fishtix$tdate, orders=c("ymd", "mdy")))
fishtix$SPGRPN2 = as.character(fishtix$SPGRPN2)
```
<br>

Node names
```{r}

#### Read in species group labels key ####
node_names <- read_csv(here::here(processdir,myfile5),
                       col_types = list(col_character(), col_character(), col_character()))

```
<br>

### 01-18-2022 NOTE COME BACK HERE TO ADD IN COLUMN NEEDED TO DETERMINE PROP WA TIX WITH ACTUAL PORT OF LANDING
### 12-31-2024. JS does not see a isPortDerived field in PacFIN

Tabulate WA fish tix to report the percentage of fish tickets for which the port assigned is derived from the license database versus the actual landing port for each year in WA. There is a “isPortDerived” field in PacFIN database. If the value is False, the port is the actual port of landing. If the value is True, the port is derived from license database. most of WA port data were derived before 2018
```{r}

fishtix %>% filter(agid == 'W') %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(
    totaltix = length(unique(trip_id)),
    num_derived_port = ,
    percentage_derived_port = 100* (num_derived_port/totaltix),
    num_actual_port = ,
    percentage_actual_port = 100 * (num_actual_port/totaltix)
  )

```


## Make Participation Networks

For each crab year and port group, this code will:
1. Create a `graph` object for each fisheries participation network, and then save the object as an R data file

2. Plot the network graphs

3. Calculate network-level statistics, and save to an output data frame.

### 1) Vessel-level networks summarized by port group

We only include vessels that generate >=`$5,000` in total fisheries revenue each year and >=`$500` in revenue from individual fisheries.

```{r}

total_rev_cutoff <- 5000
indiv_rev_cutoff <- 500
edgetype <- "connectivity"

```
<br>

```{r eval=TRUE}


# y=2019
# p = "AST"
# iopac = "Astoria"
# wc_state = "W"
for(y in years){
  for(iopac in myports){ # updated to iopac 03-10-21, was p
    cat(iopac, "\n")
    
    ### pull fish ticket data for given year, port group ###
    
    dat <- fishtix %>%
      #filter(crab_year == 2008 & IOPAC == "Bodega Bay") # this line is just for running through for loop manually
